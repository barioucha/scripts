# General
Repo with powershell and powercli scripts that I use at work.
For most of the scripts I use some functions that I had put in a powershell module. So please put the module file "slr.psm1" to your powershell module directory.

Create a directory with the same name "SLR" in C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\SLR or C:\Program Files (x86)\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\SLR etc.
